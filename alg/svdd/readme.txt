The SVDD algorithm requires a spread parameter for the RBF. This parameter must be chosen empirically given the results in Tax,Duin and Burlina, Diehl. There are some subroutines to accomplish this end but the user must be careful. Refer to the literature when trying to understand the code. The main routine svdd.m should be pretty straight forward. 

Good luck!
